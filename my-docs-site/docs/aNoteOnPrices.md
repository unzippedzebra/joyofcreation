# A Note on Prices

One of the major reasons we're able to recommend 3D printing for children's hospitals — even in resource-constrained areas — is that the cost of reliable, high-quality printers has dropped **dramatically** over the past decade.

Where durable machines once cost thousands of dollars, today's printers can often be found for just a few hundred dollars — putting this technology well within reach for projects focused on children's healing, learning, and empowerment.

However, as of 2025, prices — particularly in the United States — are experiencing a sharp and frustrating spike.  

Due to newly imposed tariffs on imported electronics and machinery, many printers have temporarily doubled in price. For example:

- The **Bambu A1 Mini**, which could be found for around **$170** in 2024, now often sells for **$360**.
- The **Bambu A1 with AMS**, once available for around **$450**, now costs closer to **$700**.

We hope this surge is temporary and largely contained to the U.S. market. Globally, 3D printing remains more affordable than ever, and remains a powerful tool for supporting sustainable local innovation.

As always, when evaluating printers for deployment, it’s a good idea to check current regional prices — and to remember that even a modest investment in 3D printing can provide incredible long-term value.
