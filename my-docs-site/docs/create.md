# Learning to Create Your Own Models

If you'd like to create your own 3D models instead of relying only on downloads, there are many beginner-friendly tools available:

## Beginner-Friendly Software

- **[TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/)**  
  Web-based, simple, and very easy for beginners. Great for basic shapes, keychains, toys, and early experiments.

- **[Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)**  
  Professional-grade CAD software with free licenses available for hobbyists. Great for mechanical parts, prototypes, and more complex designs.

- **[FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)**  
  Open-source CAD software. Powerful but a little more complex to learn compared to TinkerCad.

- **[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/)**  
  A code-based 3D modeling tool. Instead of dragging shapes, you program your models using simple scripts. Excellent for parametric design.

## Other Options

- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)**  
  While primarily known for animation and art, Blender can be used for organic 3D modeling for printing (with a steeper learning curve).

- **[Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/)**  
  Cloud-based CAD software similar to Fusion 360, accessible directly in a browser. Free for public projects.
