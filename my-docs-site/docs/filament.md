# Filament Basics

## General Notes

- **Filament Size**  
  1.75mm is the current standard for nearly all consumer 3D printers.  
  2.85mm filament (also sometimes called "3mm") is primarily used by older or industrial printers (like Ultimaker). It will not work with most modern hobbyist printers.

- **Standard Cost**  
  A 1kg roll of PLA or PETG filament typically costs between **$16–20 USD**, depending on brand and material type.

## Filament Types

### Suitable for Standard Use
- **PLA** — Easy to print, great for general purpose use.
- **PETG** — Stronger and more temperature-resistant than PLA, but can be stringier.
- **Silk PLA** — Visually striking (shiny), but brittle; not recommended for prints with moving parts or structural parts.
- **TPU** — Flexible filament used for prints that need to bend or stretch. Prints slower and may require minor settings adjustments.

### Not Suitable Without Ventilation/Enclosure
- **ABS** — Strong but prone to warping without an enclosure; releases strong fumes.
- **ASA** — UV-resistant variant of ABS, similar printing challenges.
- **Nylon** — Very tough, but absorbs moisture rapidly and warps easily without controlled conditions.
- **Polycarbonate (PC)** — Extremely strong, but demands high heat, enclosure, and careful environmental control.

??? tip "Choosing Between PLA and PETG"

    While PLA is widely considered the easiest and most beginner-friendly filament to print with, it has some important limitations:

    - It can be brittle under stress.
    - It softens at relatively low temperatures (~60°C).
    - It scratches, scuffs, and cracks more easily with frequent handling.

    If you are printing parts that will be **frequently touched, flexed, or exposed to minor heat** —  
    (such as toys, handles, mechanical parts, or fixtures) —   **PETG is often a better choice.**

    PETG is:

    - More impact-resistant
    - More flexible (less likely to crack)
    - More temperature resistant (softens closer to 80°C)

## Reputable Filament Brands

Today, most filament brands offer good baseline quality.  

Common issues like poor layer adhesion, stringing, or brittle prints usually stem from **moisture absorption** — not manufacturing defects.

Some cheaper brands may occasionally suffer from:
- Tangles inside spools
- Slight diameter inconsistencies

However, many modern printers (such as Bambu Lab models) now offer **tangle detection**, making these issues less disruptive than they once were.

> **Tip:**  
> Storing filament properly in a dry environment or using a filament dryer can dramatically improve print consistency — even with budget brands.

Choosing a good filament brand helps minimize print failures and improves print quality — but the good news is, there are a lot of reliable options today across different budgets.

## Premium Brands

- **Prusament** (by Prusa)  
    - Highly consistent diameter tolerance (±0.02mm)  
    - Excellent quality control and documentation (every spool has a full quality report)  
    - Ships from the Czech Republic — longer shipping times and higher shipping costs for some regions.

- **Jessie Filament** (by Printed Solid, now owned by Prusa)  
    - Made in the USA.  
    - High-quality, colorful filament options at competitive mid-tier pricing.  
    - Reliable customer service and consistent batches.

- **Protopasta**  
    - Premium filaments with unique composites (glitter, carbon fiber, magnetic iron, etc.).  
    - **Expensive** compared to standard PLA/PETG.  
    - Great for specialty projects where appearance or material properties matter.

- **CookieCAD Filaments**  
    - Specialty color collections and designer shades.  
    - Also **expensive**, but offers vibrant, unique finishes not easily found elsewhere.

## Midrange Brands

- **Polymaker**  
    - Well-respected for high-quality basic materials and specialty filaments (PolyLite, PolyMax, etc.).  
    - Widely available globally.  
    - Slightly more expensive than basic brands but very reliable.

## Budget-Friendly Brands

- **eSun**  
    - One of the most popular budget filament brands.  
    - Consistent quality for the price, although occasional wet spools may happen (especially with PETG).

- **Sunlu**  
    - Another common budget option.  
    - Very affordable and decent quality for prototyping and non-critical prints.  
    - Moisture sensitivity can be higher — drying before use can make a noticeable difference.

- **Overture**  
    - Reliable, beginner-friendly brand often found on Amazon.  
    - Slightly better QC reputation than other "cheap" brands.  
    - Good choice for everyday printing without too much worry.

## Final Note

> It's increasingly rare to find truly bad filament brands today.  
> Most filament-related problems are caused by **improper storage (moisture absorption)** rather than poor manufacturing.  
>  
> Keeping filament dry and properly stored has a bigger impact on print quality than brand name alone.
