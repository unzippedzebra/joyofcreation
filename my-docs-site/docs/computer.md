## Computers for 3D Printing

While you can run a 3D printer using just a mobile app, especially with newer systems like Bambu Lab printers, having a proper computer is highly recommended.

Mobile apps (such as the Bambu Handy app) can handle basic functions like:

- Starting pre-sliced prints
- Monitoring progress via camera feeds
- Pausing or canceling prints

However, mobile control has **important limitations**:

- **Reduced slicing control**: You typically rely on pre-made project files or very simple presets.
- **Limited troubleshooting options**: Diagnosing problems like layer shifts, adhesion issues, or tuning print settings is much harder without full slicer access.
- **Less visibility**: Important slicing settings (like infill percentage, supports, temperatures) are harder to verify or adjust easily.
- **Dependency on cloud services**: Mobile workflows often assume an always-online connection.

**For full control, especially if you want to slice your own models or troubleshoot effectively, a basic computer is highly recommended.**

### Minimum Recommended Specs for a 3D Printing Computer

- **CPU**: Intel Core i5 (8th Gen or newer) or AMD Ryzen 5 (3000 series or newer)
- **RAM**: 8 GB minimum (16 GB recommended for heavier modeling work)
- **Storage**: SSD strongly recommended (at least 256 GB)
- **GPU**: Integrated graphics are fine for slicing. A basic dedicated GPU (like NVIDIA GTX 1650 or newer) helps if you plan to do more complex 3D modeling.
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS 12+, or a modern Linux distro

> *Cloud-based modeling software like TinkerCad or Onshape can run on lower-spec machines, but you'll still benefit from a reasonably fast, reliable device.*

**Summary:**  
While mobile apps are useful for monitoring and starting prints, a dedicated computer gives you full slicing, editing, troubleshooting, and project control â€” and is strongly recommended for anything beyond very basic printing.
