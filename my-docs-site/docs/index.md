# Welcome to the 3D Printing Project!


## Why 3D Printing?

A 3D printer in a children's hospital isn't just about technology â€” it's about creating opportunities. From custom toys that spark imagination to assistive tools and educational aids, a single machine can support play, healing, and daily needs.

A 3D printer empowers the hospital to design and create solutions tailored to their needs: assistive devices, educational tools, replacement parts, and small innovations that support daily operations. It also opens the door to sustainable practices, making it easier to repair, reuse, and recycle materials. Broken prints and unused parts can be reclaimed, closing the loop and helping to build a culture of resilience and resourcefulness.
