# Choosing a Printer

When selecting a 3D printer — whether you're sticking to our recommended models or exploring other options — it’s critical to prioritize **safety** and **reliability** first.  
Below are features that are **non-negotiable** and **essential** for any printer intended for this project.


> **Note:**  
> This project focuses on **FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)** 3D printing — the most common, beginner-friendly type that uses melted filament.  
> 
> **Resin printing** (SLA/DLP) is a completely different process that involves liquid resin, UV curing, and specific safety equipment.  
> 
> If you're interested in resin printing, be aware that it requires additional gear like gloves, respirators, and specialized ventilation.

## Non-Negotiable Features

### Thermal Runaway Protection
An essential safety feature that prevents potential fire hazards.

If the printer detects that the heating element is not behaving properly — for example, the thermistor fails or comes loose — the system will automatically shut down. 

**Do not skip this.**  

Most modern 3D printers include thermal runaway protection, but be cautious: some older models or no-name brands may lack this critical safeguard.

## Essential Modern Features

These features dramatically improve reliability, ease of use, and maintenance — especially in environments where consistent support may not always be available.

### Input Shaping
Helps minimize vibrations during fast movements, improving print quality and allowing faster, more reliable prints without sacrificing detail.

### Automatic Bed Leveling
Simplifies setup and ensures the first layer sticks properly.  
Reduces the need for manual leveling, which can be frustrating and error-prone — especially for beginners or in environments where many people may interact with the machine.

### Filament Runout Sensor
Detects when filament runs out or breaks during a print.  
Automatically pauses the printer, preventing failed prints and wasted material — particularly important for larger, multi-hour prints.

### Quick Swap Nozzle / Hotend Design
Allows for fast, easy replacement of nozzles or hotends.  
Minimizes downtime when maintenance is needed and reduces the risk of damage from complicated disassembly.

### Power Loss Recovery
Saves print progress if the machine unexpectedly loses power.  
Enables the printer to resume where it left off once power is restored, preventing loss of time, materials, and energy.

**Note:**  
While features like Wi-Fi connectivity, touchscreens, or fancy enclosures can be useful, they are *not* essential. Focus first on these core safety and reliability features when evaluating a printer for real-world, sustainable use.

??? danger "Click to expand: What to Avoid"
    - **No Thermal Runaway Protection:**  
    Always double-check. If documentation or reviewers don't mention it, assume it's not there.

    - **Proprietary Filament Requirements:**  
      Some brands lock you into using only their expensive filament cartridges or chips. Avoid anything that restricts your filament choices.

    - **No Firmware Update Support:**  
      Printers without accessible or maintained firmware can quickly become unsafe or unreliable as they age.

    - **Missing Basic Documentation:**  
      If the printer lacks a clear user manual, online resources, or community support, troubleshooting will be much harder.

    - **Overly Cheap, No-Name Brands:**  
      Extremely low-cost printers from unfamiliar brands often cut corners on safety, reliability, and durability.

    - **Fragile or Poorly Designed Parts:**  
      Look for signs of bad design — wobbly frames, weak bed mounts, or extremely thin plastic components are bad signs.

    - **No Spare Parts Availability:**  
      If you can't easily buy replacement nozzles, belts, fans, or boards, the printer may have a very short usable life.
