## Core Maintenance Supplies

- **Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA)**  
  At least 90% or higher purity recommended.  
  Used to clean the print bed before every print to improve adhesion.

- **Microfiber Cloths or Lint-Free Wipes**  
  Used with IPA to wipe down the build surface without leaving fibers behind.

- **Filament Dryer**  
  Essential for maintaining filament quality, especially for moisture-sensitive materials like PETG, TPU, and Nylon.

- **Nozzle Cleaning Tools**  
  Small cleaning needles or wire brushes can help clear minor clogs.

- **Digital Calipers**  
  Handy for checking part dimensions, filament diameter, and tuning printer settings.

## Optional: Adhesion Helpers

In most cases — especially printing PLA on modern PEI beds — **you don't need glue sticks, hairspray, or other adhesion hacks**.  
A clean bed, a good first layer, and slicer features like **brims** are usually enough.

However, in certain cases:
- Printing **large flat models** that are prone to warping
- Printing on **less ideal build surfaces** (like plain glass)
- Using **materials prone to shrinkage** (like ABS)

you might find it helpful to have a **glue stick** or **bed adhesive** available as a backup.

> **Tip:**  
> Before reaching for glue, try adjusting your slicer settings — **Brims** (a thin skirt attached to your model) or slightly lowering your Z-offset are often simpler and cleaner solutions.


## What Comes With Most New Printers

Most new printers include a small starter maintenance kit, which usually contains:

- A basic scraper for removing prints from the bed
- A few nozzle cleaning needles
- A spare nozzle
- Hex keys (Allen wrenches) for basic assembly and repairs
- Maybe a small roll of filament (sample size)

> **Note:**  
> These included tools are enough to get started, but they tend to be very basic.  
> Over time, you may want to invest in sturdier or more specialized tools depending on your needs.

## Optional But Helpful

- **Extra Nozzles**  
  Nozzles are consumables. Brass nozzles are fine for PLA, but wear quickly if printing abrasive materials like carbon fiber-filled filament.  
  Hardened steel or ruby-tipped nozzles last much longer for specialty materials.

- **Spare Build Surface (PEI Sheet)**  
  If your printer has a removable bed, keeping a spare textured or smooth PEI sheet around can be handy, especially for printing different materials.

- **Tweezers**  
  Fine-tip tweezers are great for clearing small filament blobs from the nozzle during warmup.

- **Compressed Air**  
  Helps clean dust and filament debris from hard-to-reach parts of the printer.

**Summary:**  
Start with IPA, microfiber cloths, and a basic maintenance kit — and build up from there as you print more.  
Keeping your printer clean and your filament dry makes a huge difference in print success.
