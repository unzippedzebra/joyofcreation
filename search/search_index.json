For example:</p> <ul> <li>The Bambu A1 Mini, which could be found for around $170 in 2024, now often sells for $360.</li> <li>The Bambu A1 with AMS, once available for around $450, now costs closer to $700.</li> </ul> <p>We hope this surge is temporary and largely contained to the U.S. market. Globally, 3D printing remains more affordable than ever, and remains a powerful tool for supporting sustainable local innovation.</p> <p>As always, when evaluating printers for deployment, it\u2019s a good idea to check current regional prices \u2014 and to remember that even a modest investment in 3D printing can provide incredible long-term value.</p>"},{"location":"choosingAPrinter/","title":"Choosing a Printer","text":"<p>When selecting a 3D printer \u2014 whether you're sticking to our recommended models or exploring other options \u2014 it\u2019s critical to prioritize safety and reliability first.
